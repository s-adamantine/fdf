1. count the number of columns, multiply that by the tile width
	- need to account for the offsets to the sides too though
	- though prob would be more applicable once we transform it
2. count the number of lines too
3. transformation process must happen before we draw into the image really
	- you can transform it into 2d w/ regular equations
	- matrix multiply to get the z matrix
	- then add the x/y w/ the x matrix
	- will have lots of overlap tho
	- how do i get rid of those
